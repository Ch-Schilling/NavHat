## Design
The design is made using KiCad. It is impressive how well that open source system is capable of drawing schematics and designing PCBs! Cudos to the KiCad team. Get the design files from the KiCad folder.
The board is designed for four copper layers to achieve the densitiy needed for the small footprint of the HAT as well as thermal and EMI reasons. For easyer manufacturing, components are populated on the top side only. KiCad and open hardware logos are printed on the bottom side of the board.

### Power Supply
To operate a Raspberry Pi with Navigation HAT independent of other installation, two fuses are on board. F1 (approx. 3A) is installed in the path of the power supply for the Raspberry Pi, F2 (approx. 20A) is in place for the four power outlets.
The fuses are specified for 32V DC, therefore the supply voltage shall not exceed this value.
To achieve high efficiency, low noise, low stand-by current and a wide voltage input the TI LM62460 was chosen. The part also offers a wide range switching frequency and a spread spectrum option. To optimize efficiency, the switching frequency is set to 488kHz. Higher frequencies would allow to use smaller inductors. An EMI filter is used at the battery side. Electrolythic capacitors are waived, purely ceramic capacitors are used. See schematics page 2 and the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/product/de-de/LM62460) of the manufacturer.
The Enable signal EN_POWER of the device is controlled by a flip-flop U4. EN_POWER is high and remains high if POWER_ON gets low by an external signal like a button, power-on cycle or an interrupt of the RTC. The flip-flop consumes very little power, it has to remain on by a low Iq linear regulator U2. In case of shutting down the Raspberry Pi, the gpio-poweroff driver is used to rise the clock signal of the flip-flop, disabling the DC/DC converter and put it into ÂµA current consumption sleep mode. To do so, this needs to be added in the /boot/firmware/config.txt file:
```
dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpiopin=5,active-delay-ms=1000
```
The active-delay is not mandatory, but seems to be a good idea.
> Note: Make sure that there are no pending interrups of the RTC, otherwise the flip-flop cannot change state and turn off the DC/DC converter.

### Power Outlets
To control lights, relays or board instruments 4 power outlets are available. The high side switche family [TPS2HB](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS2HB16-Q1) of TI is used. The parts provide low R_on resistance, current limiter and -monitoring as well as temperature monitoring. Made for the automotive market, they seem to be a good fit for boating applications, too. The parts are controlled via a I2C port extension device MCP23017. To save the part from reverse polarity 15kOhm resistors are used in all digital paths as described in the application notes.
A fraction of the output current can be fed throug a sense resistor to measure the output current. The voltage across the shunt resistor can be measured by the on-board ADC. Optionally, the first two switches can be controlled by the PWM engine of the Raspberry Pi. Please be aware that not all features of that mini computer can be used at the same time.
> Warning: Do not drive PWM and the corresponding pin of the IO expander at the same time. One of these signals shall remain as an input.

### NMEA Interfaces
The NMEA 2000, CAN interface is implemented using a Microchip MCP25625. The MCP25625 is a more modern and compact device containing a MCP2515 and corresponding bus driver. It creates a one chip solution from SPI to CAN bridge. From the Raspberry Pi's perspecive the MCP2515 driver is used. Make sure the /boot/firmware/config.txt contains the following:
```
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=20000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=2000000
```
In a console, configure the CAN bus for NMEA 2000:
```
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 250000
sudo ip link set can0 txqueuelen 65536
```
Check for can0 interface using
```
ip link
```
candump displays the traffic in a console. NMEA 2000 bus data should be easily visible but not readable. 
```
candump can0
```

For more details pyssel describes to setup NMEA 2000 with a CAN HAT on their [webpage](https://pysselilivet.blogspot.com/2022/05/waveshare-can-hat-with-signal-k.html)

For NMEA 0183 devices and/or other serial devices, a MAX14830 bridges SPI to quad UART. The first two UARTs are converted into RS-422 signals and fed to connector J9. The last two UARTs can be converted to RS-232 signals and fed to connector J10. One can use the TTL signals but one has to disable the converter chip U13 and put it into shutdown mode. The quad UART U12 could have its own quatz, since it has a wide possibility of options to create its clocks, the clockout of the CAN chip U9 shall be used instead.
The CAN and RS-422 interfaces have an option of a termination resistor of typically 120Ohm, but these resistors are not populated by default. ESD protection diodes are used except for the RS-422 devices, they have large enough built-in protection.

### Sensors and Sensor Interfaces
There are a wide variety of sensors with I2C interface. On board, the following parts share the user accessible I2C bus of the Raspberry Pi:
* MCP23017 I/O Port extension for controlling the power outlets
* ADS1119 analog to digital converter for measuring current and temperature of the power outlets
* MAX31343 RTC for wake up calls
* BMP390 barometric pressure sensor

The BMP390 is susceptible to stress. It is placed at the edge of the board in between two cutouts. Stress to the board is not passed to the part where the sensor is soldered to.
  
There are two [STEMMA](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma) connectors J3 and J4 as well as a STEMMA QT / Qwiic connector J5. The power pin of J5 is hooked up from linear regulator U2. It provides 3.3V even if the main DC/DC converter is switched off. This allows low power sensors to continue to operate without operation of the computer. The header J7 also carries the two I2C signals. There should be plenty of options to add I2C sensors to the system.
Connector J2 is prepared for 1-wire devices inclusive 5kOhm pull-up and 3.3V and 5V to chose from.

A nice option for environmental monitoring of temperature and humidity, the part HDC3020 can be used. It is not on board because the environment of the computer system is typically not representative for the environment to be monitored. The part continues to measure these parameters, even if there is no I2C communication. It stores the minimum and maximum measurements of temperature and rel. humidity. This is an excellent choise to connect to J5 to be powered, even when the Raspberry Pi is off. The computer can read the min. and max. readings when it is awake again.

### Configuration
#### EEPROM
Page 6 of the schematics shows hardware configurations of the board. The HAT specification requires a EEPROM describing the HAT and holds information about power delivery and required drivers. Unlike the proposal of the HAT specification, a software configurable EEPROM is used. This allows to set the I2C address as well as the write protection of the device within a minimal board space. Gaining write access to the device from user space is relatively complicated, therefore an accidential write access is highly unlikely.

Writing to the configuration EEPROM is easy using the software gpio driver. A new bus is createt, for example 9. Use this driver only temporary before accessing the configuration memory to prevent unwanted modification.
```sh
sudo dtoverlay i2c-gpio i2c_gpio_sda=0 i2c_gpio_scl=1 bus=9
```
Check if somebody is home. The memory chips are expected in the address range 0x50 ... 0x57.
```sh
i2cdetect -y 9

     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
50: 50 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

check configuraton directory for files and scripts. The eep tools are used to create binary files from a text description and writing the image into the configuration memory. See HAT documentation for more details. A device tree blob can be added to the binary description which is executed at boot time. The power-5A.dtbo promisses to provide 5A current. The Raspberry Pi 5 is complaining about a weak power supply if that is not provided.
```sh
eepmake  -v1 eeprom_navhat.txt eeprom_navhat.eep power-5A.dtbo
```
The shell script eepflash.sh finally writes the image into the memory device.
```sh
sudo eepflash.sh -w -f eeprom_navhat.eep -d=9 -t=24c64
```
To set the I2C Address of the device or write protecting the memory content, eeprom_config.py can be used. 
```sh
python3 eeprom_config.py -b 9 -a 0x52 --write-protect
```
changes the address to 0x52 and sets the write protection.
The device tree blob is created from its source file like that:
```sh
dtc -@ -O dtb -I dts -o power-5A.dtbo power-5A.dts
```
The build.sh script executes these commands in the correct order.


#### SPI 
Chip select and interrup pin for the CAN- and UART controller are prepared for two options. The options can be chosen by using the corresponding resistor.

#### I2C
The signal I2C_ADDR0 can be set to logic 0 or logic 1. It is connected to the lowest address bit of the pressure sensor U5, the ADC U8 and the port extender U15. The I2C address of these devices can be rised by 1 commonly in case of conflict with other devices.

The following table shows the I2C addresses of the different devices. A0 corresponds to the configuration of the I2C_ADDR0 which can be set by the resistors R56 and R57. A0 = 0 if R57 is populated and A0 = 1 if R56 is populated, respectively.

|Device|Address|
|:-----|:------|
|MCP23017|0x22 + A0|
|BMP390|0x76 + A0|
|ADS1119|0x48 + A0|
|MAX31343|0x68|
|HDC3020|0x44|
